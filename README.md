# Simplify Category List

Discourse theme component simplifying the category list (the standard styles, not boxed) by removing the "X / week" column.
I think this column is useless and only distracts users.
If for whatever reason you want to estimate how active a category is (which probably doesnâ€™t happen often, and mostly useful for admins),
you can just look at the dates in the Latest column, or open it and check some topics.
